flash with win32 or dd

place card in BeagleBone, hold boot button, plug in cord, wait for 4 lights to go on, release boot,
wait for OS to load

ssh into BeagleBone
    ip:     192.168.7.2
    user:   Debian
    pswd:   temppwd

delete empty bin folder
    rmdir bin

connect to wifi
    ~ ifconfig
    verify wlan0 is listed

    ~ connmanctl

    ~ enable wifi
    : Error wifi: Already enabled

    ~ scan wifi
    : Scan completed for wifi
    Must wait for message

    ~ services
    : Shows list of networks in format : Name Code

    ~ agent on
    : Agent registered

    ~ connect <Code>
    : Passphrase?
    ~ <Enter password>
    : Connected to <Code>
    Must wait for message

    ~ quit

    ~ ifconfig    
    verify wlan0 now has IP address

    ~ ping google.com
    verify you are getting a response

    ** Note: sometimes after reboot, wifi will not be working
    **       try running this command to fix:
    **           ~ sudo ip link set wlan0 up

setup linux environment
    ~ git clone https://ml-davis@bitbucket.org/ml-davis/linux_config.git
    copy bashrc, inputrc, profile, vimrc, vim folder to home folder
    now your environment is a little more sane

clone mr_robot
    ~ apt-get install https://github.com/amirbawab/mr_robot.git
    doesn't work. Network crashes...

    scp mr_robot into beaglebone

activate spi
    
    device tree overlays are stored in /lib/firmware
    we can see them by moving into directory and listing files
    you can also build your own with dts files

    in order to see which devices are loaded, we must view our slots, stored under:
        /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
    can make environment variable if you want ($SLOTS)
    cat it to view contents of slot file
    
    we can see an unwanted device:
         4: P-O-L-   0 Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,cape-universaln

    this device is loaded on boot. To prevent this, edit: 
        /boot/uEnv.txt
    comment out cape_universal=enable (typically line 49)
        cmdline=coherent_pool=1M net.ifnames=0 quiet cape_universal=enable
    change to:
        cmdline=coherent_pool=1M net.ifnames=0 quiet #cape_universal=enable

    alternatively can remove it by:
        echo -4 > $SLOTS
    however, this typically breaks...

    reboot device and ssh back in

    to export a dto, write the name of the dto without the 00A0.dtbo to the slots file:
        sudo sh -c "echo BB-SPIDEV0 > $SLOTS"

    view slots file again

    verify spidev0 is loaded:
        ~ cat /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
        : 0: PF----  -1
        : 1: PF----  -1
        : 2: PF----  -1
        : 3: PF----  -1
        : 4: P-O-L-   0 Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,BB-SPIDEV0

test spi
    navigate to ~/mr_robot/tools/control/
    may need to change permissions of write file
        ~ chmod ugo+x write
    
    run executable:
        ~ ./write 255,255#

    doesn't work

Alternative spi setup
    ensure cape universal is loaded
        if cape_universal is commented out, (see first active spi section), uncomment it and reboot
            cmdline=coherent_pool=1M net.ifnames=0 quiet cape_universal=enable

    make sure it worked:
        ~ cat $SLOTS
        : 4: P-O-L-   0 Override Board Name,00A0,Override Manuf,cape-universaln

    set your 4 spi pins to spi mode
        config-pin -l P9.17 #SPI0_CS
        config-pin -l P9.18 #SPI0_D1
        config-pin -l P9.22 #SPI0_SCLK
        config-pin -l P9.21 #SPI0_D0

    verify that they were set:
        config-pin -q P9.17
        config-pin -q P9.18
        config-pin -q P9.21
        config-pin -q P9.22

        still doesn't work
